For Project 1, you will develop a single page website about yourself. This is your personal portfolio/Online CV. This assignment focuses on HTML and CSS, and the structure and presentation of your web page.

Project Setup
Create a new directory (folder) on your computer called “myfolio” for example.

The entry point of your project should be named “index.html”. Your CSS and image files should be placed in a separate folder called assets. All file and directory names should be limited to letters, numbers, and dashes and be lowercase, with no spaces. You will also create a GitHub repo with a matching name to which you will push the code, and deploy it to Heroku. 

Your Website
The focus of this assignment is on creating a static web page with HTML and CSS. 

Your webpage should include both images and text and contain a section for your bio-data, a section for your education qualifications, the projects you have worked on and the skills you possess, hobbies and pastimes, (include a few photos showing you do your hobbies if available) and your contact information.  The text content should be original, written by you; feel free to adapt from previous work as appropriate. Images that you use do not need to be original but should be credited whenever possible.  There should be semantic section elements on your page, including but not limited to <main>, <header>, and <footer>.

Detailed requirements
Your website should meet all of the following requirements.

A new single page website with all sections listed above.
Website should be in its own sub-directory and the home page should be an “index.html” file.
Page should contain both paragraph and heading text, at least one table (with as many rows and columns as you want) and use div elements to control the layout of your elements.
Include at least one image in JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG format.
You should use semantic html tags to structure your page content, including <main>, <header>, and <footer>.
An external CSS file that is properly linked to the webpage you've designed, that includes at least 5 different classes or IDs that modify elements of the linked webpage.
At least one of the classes or IDs must control layout using layers (Div tag), and the rest should modify properties such as fonts, colors, background-color, etc. If you want an extra challenge, research how to control some other CSS properties that you think would be useful when designing webpages and use it.
